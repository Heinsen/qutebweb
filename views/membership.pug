If you are interested in going overseas or making international friends this is the role for you! <br />

						| EXCHANGIE <br />
						| ONLY FOR EXCHANGE STUDENTS.
					.p| An exchangie is a foreign student on exchange for 1 or 2 semesters. If you are feeling a bit apprehensive about coming to Queensland and want to get to know some QUT students, make sure you sign up so we can put you in a group! You can choose to be in a group or to just be a member. For organisational reasons, only the first 120 exchange students who want to be in a group will be placed in one.  <br />
					.p.membership_subtitle|	DATES TO BE IN A BUDDY GROUP FOR EACH SEMESTER ARE YET TO BE RELEASED.
